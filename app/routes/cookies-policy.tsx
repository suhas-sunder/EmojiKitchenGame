          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,
            http://emojikitchengame.com) are called 'first-party cookies.'
            Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called
            'third-party cookies.' Third-party cookies enable third-party
            features or functionality to be provided on or through the website
            (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
            that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both
            when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
            certain other websites.
          </p>
          <h3>Google Analytics cookies and identifiers</h3>
          <p>
            Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on
            visitor (aka. user) interactions on Google Analytics customers‚Äô
            websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.
            In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser add-on
            that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Google
            Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only
            disables Google Analytics measurement. Where a site or app uses
            Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs,
            Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier ‚Äî a randomly
            generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App.
            Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID
            on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance
            identifier is also reset. Where sites or apps have implemented
            Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like Google
            Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Users can
            opt-out of this feature and manage their settings for this cookie
            using the

          <h2 className="flex py-2 text-2xl">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
            cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website
            to operate, and we refer to these as 'essential' or 'strictly
            necessary' cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target
            the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
            Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
            advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in
            more detail below.

          <h2 className="flex py-2 text-2xl">How can I control cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
            You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in
            the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
            select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
            cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
            you with services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner
            and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still
            use our website though your access to some functionality and areas
            of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web
            browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.

            The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through
            our Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table

            As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web
            browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your
            browser's help menu for more information. The following is

            What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
            website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
            like web beacons (sometimes called 'tracking pixels' or 'clear
            gifs'). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
            identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
            Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for
            example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
            within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies,
            to understand whether you have come to the website from an online
            advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
            performance, and to measure the success of email marketing
            campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on
            cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair
            their functioning.

            Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

          <p>
            Websites may also use so-called 'Flash Cookies' (also known as Local
            Shared Objects or 'LSOs') to, among other things, collect and store
            information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and

            If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
            adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies
            storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings
            Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global
            Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may
            include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
            existing Flash Cookies (referred to 'information' on the Macromedia
            site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer
            without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to
